Those free-thinking spheres want to bring THEIR "primary" color into
our themed world... DESTROY THEM ALL

Here are the types of weirdos you may encounter:
GREEN WEIRDO - Originates from the Church of Latter Day Greens, their
               mission is to bring false hope and kind thoughts to all
               other green spheres. Red spheres are believed to be spawn
               of Cain. Kill on sight.
RED WEIRDO   - This brand of weirdo is a sick one, they believe in redma,
               the act of doing to others what you wish to yourself.
               Kill on sight.
BLUE WEIRDO  - These guys aren't that bad, but I don't want to look
               spherist or anything like that. Kill on sight.
